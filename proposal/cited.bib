Cohesive elements are introduced along the boundaries of the inner layers and inside the transverse plies to simulate the spontaneous initiation and propagation of transverse matrix cracks and delamination fronts. The analysis is performed within the framework of the finite deformation theory of elasticity to account for the nonlinear stiffening of the thin composite plate and the large rotations which accompany the fracture process. The simulation is dynamic and uses an explicit time stepping scheme. Comparison with existing experiments performed on graphite/epoxy laminates indicates that the cohesive/volumetric finite element scheme is able to capture the complex mechanisms leading to the delamination, including the initial micro-cracking of the matrix, the appearance of critical transverse matrix cracks and the rapid propagation of delamination cracks initiated at the intersections between the critical matrix cracks and the adjacent plies.}

Spontaneous crack propagation was simulated using a spectral form of the elastodynamic boundary integral equation, while steady-state solutions were obtained by numerically integrating the governing Cauchy singular integral equation. Spontaneous crack propagation results showed that intrinsic models are less numerically stable than the extrinsic ones. Under steady-state propagation conditions, some intrinsic cohesive models lead to unrealistic results as the crack opening velocity becomes negative at the cohesive zone tip. By imposing a positive crack opening acceleration at the cohesive zone tip, the envelope of the required minimum initial strength has been calculated.}

                 computing environments is a difficult task. The
                 Distributed object migration environment (Dome)
                 addresses three major issues of parallel computing in
                 an architecture independent manner: ease of
                 programming, dynamic load balancing, and fault
                 tolerance. Dome programmers, with modest effort, can
                 write parallel programs that are automatically
                 distributed over a heterogeneous network, dynamically
                 load balanced as the program runs, and able to survive
                 compute node and network failures. This paper provides
                 the motivation for and an overview of Dome, including a
                 preliminary performance evaluation of dynamic load
                 balancing for distributed vectors. Dome programs are
                 shorter and easier to write than the equivalent
                 programs written with message passing primitives. The
                 performance overhead of Dome is characterized, and it
                 is shown that this overhead can be recouped by dynamic
                 load balancing in imbalanced systems. Finally, we show
                 that a parallel program can be made failure resilient
                 through Dome's architecture independent checkpoint and
                 restart mechanisms.",

    Abstract = {Debugging optimized code is a problem for which a widely accepted solution has yet to be found. Over the years many approaches have been suggested, including limiting the compiler optimizations, restricting the debugger functionality, using recompilation or dynamic de-optimization to undo the optimizations, and having the debugger determine the effects of optimizations and mask them from the user. All of these approaches have a common thread: they place a barrier between the user and the optimizations, either altering, undoing, or hiding the effects of optimizations. <p>This work presents a completely different approach. By allowing users to see some of the effects of optimizations, many of the problems traditionally associated with debugging optimized code are either simplified or eliminated. The basic idea is to generate an optimized version of the source program, which accurately reflects the effects of the compiler optimizations. The user and the debugger then communicate via this optimized source program. <p>The theoretical issues involved in generating optimized source code, as well as the compiler support necessary for debugging optimized code are presented in this work. It also explores options for displaying the optimized source program to the user in the most useful, least confusing manner. It introduces the concept of key instructions and shows how they are critical for simplifying determining current variable locations within the executable, and mapping accurately between binary instructions and statements in the optimized source program. It also presents a pioneering approach for eviction recovery within the debugger. <p>These ideas have been fully implemented in Optview and Optdbx, which are described in this dissertation. Optview is a prototype tool that generates optimized source code for C programs. It is embedded within the SGI MIPS-Pro 7.2 C compiler. Optdbx is a modified version of the SGI dbx debugger, which makes use of the optimized source code. It contains the only known implementation of eviction recovery, and it has a simple graphical user interface for displaying the optimized source program to the user. Experiments on these systems have proven that this approach provides a simple, practical, complete solution to the difficult problem of debugging optimized code.}

  abstract={Building fast, reliable, and adaptive software is a constant challenge for computational science, especially given recent developments in computer architecture. This paper outlines some of our efforts to address these three issues in the context of computational chemistry. First, a simple linear performance that can be used to model and predict the performance of Hartree-Fock calculations is discussed. Second, the use of interval arithmetic to assess the numerical reliability of the sort of integrals used in electronic structure methods is presented. Third, use of dynamic code modification as part of a framework to support adaptive software is outlined.}

abstract ={Driven by the availability of experimental data and ability to simulate a biological scale which is of immediate interest, the cellular scale is fast emerging as an ideal candidate for middle-out modelling. As with ‚Äòbottom-up‚Äô simulation approaches, cellular level simulations demand a high degree of computational power, which in large-scale simulations can only be achieved through parallel computing. The flexible large-scale agent modelling environment (FLAME) is a template driven framework for agent-based modelling (ABM) on parallel architectures ideally suited to the simulation of cellular systems. It is available for both high performance computing clusters (www.flame.ac.uk) and GPU hardware (www.flamegpu.com) and uses a formal specification technique that acts as a universal modelling format. This not only creates an abstraction from the underlying hardware architectures, but avoids the steep learning curve associated with programming them. In benchmarking tests and simulations of advanced cellular systems, FLAME GPU has reported massive improvement in performance over more traditional ABM frameworks. This allows the time spent in the development and testing stages of modelling to be drastically reduced and creates the possibility of real-time visualisation for simple visual face-validation.},
